🎀 Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors – Coquette Version 🎀
⋅˚₊‧ ୨୧ ‧₊˚ ⋅ First one to 10 points wins! ⋅˚₊‧ ୨୧ ‧₊˚ ⋅

────୨ৎ──── This is my submission for the Guided Inquiry Week 6 assignment, and it features a fun and interactive version of Rock, Paper, Scissors. ────୨ৎ────

What’s in this project?
This repository contains the core files to play the Rock, Paper, Scissors game, and it’s hosted on Vercel where you can play it directly in your browser. 

Here's an overview of the files and what they do:

Files in this repository:
- README.md: You’re reading it! This file provides an introduction to the project and explains how everything works.

- index.html: Contains all the text content and the structure of the game. It's where the game interface is built.

- style.css: Includes the styles for the game. It also contains links to fonts and background images. The page is fully responsive, so it looks great on any device.

- index.js: The heart of the game! This JavaScript file contains the core game logic. It handles player input, the computer’s random selection, game results, and score updates. You’ll find comments throughout to explain how each part works.


You can also access the live game through the Vercel link.


* * Why I deserve a 4?
I believe I deserve a score of 4 because I’ve met all the requirements for the project, including both the core features and the optional challenges.

Core Features:
- Players can select their option (Rock, Paper, or Scissors).

- Once an option is selected, the computer also picks an option randomly. The results are displayed, showing whether the player won, lost, or tied.

Optional Challenges:
- Score counter: The game keeps track of the score (wins, losses, and ties).

Reset button: A reset button is included to allow the player to clear the score and start a new game.


Key Takeaways:

Throughout this project, I learned several important JavaScript and web development concepts that will help me in future projects.

Key Concepts I Learned:
- Variables (let, const):
let is used for variables that change (like the score), while const is used for variables that do not change (like the options array).

- Arrays:
Arrays store a collection of elements. In this game, the options array holds the choices ("rock", "paper", "scissors").

- Event Listeners (addEventListener):
Event listeners make the game interactive. For example, clicking a button triggers the corresponding game action.

- Conditionals (if, else, switch):
Conditional statements are used to determine the result of the game based on the player's and computer's choices. For example, the game checks if the player's choice is the same as the computer’s, and whether the player wins or loses.

- CSS Class Manipulation (classList.add(), classList.remove()):
These methods are used to dynamically change the appearance of the result text. Depending on the outcome (win, lose, or tie), the text color changes.

- Randomization (Math.random()):
The computer's choice is randomized using Math.random() to ensure the game is unpredictable and fun.

- Incrementing (++):
The shorthand ++ operator is used to update the score by adding 1 when the player or computer wins.



How to Play
- Click on one of the buttons to select your move: Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
- The computer will randomly pick a move.
- The game will then display the result: You Win!, You Lose!, or It’s a Tie!.
- The score will update after each round.
- Hit the Reset button to start a new game.


What’s Next?
This project is a great learning experience, but I am looking forward to enhancing it further:
- Adding more advanced features like multiplayer mode.
- Adding a drop down menu that displays “How to Play.” 
- Adding sound effects for better interactivity.
